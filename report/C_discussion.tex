% (recommended size: 1 page): summarize the main findings of your work and discuss the tradeoffs inherent in the design of the DAS system. Should WantGame use a distributed system to implement the DAS system? Try to extrapolate from the results reported in Section 6.b for system workloads that are orders of magnitude higher than what you have tried in real-world experiments.
We have learned a lot from attempting this challenge of making a distributed game. We learned what the different challenges are, looking at the characteristics of distributed systems, such as scalability, fault tolerance and performance. Most importantly, we learned that making a distributed system costs a lot of time and effort. We are disappointed that we did not have the time to implement the proposed system and hope to improve this in the future.
