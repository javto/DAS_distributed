WantGame b.v. wanted to know if they should make a distributed game, with requirements of the game itself, fault tolerance and scalability. The distributed game itself is not implemented, this paper proposes an implementation using Trailing State Servers. A number of experiment designs are described to assess three characteristics of a distributed system: scalability, performance and fault tolerance.  The results of the proposed experiments can be useful information to improve the game and calculate thresholds for when to start and shut down servers. We recommend WantGame to start with a centralized version and continue developing the distributed version. This is to start generating revenue and assess the level of interest in the game.
