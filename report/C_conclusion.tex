\section{Conclusion}
\label{chap:con}
To conclude, we have attempted at making a distributed game, but instead made a proposal of a fault tolerant system using TSSs and made a rough implementation which can be found on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/javto/DAS\_distributed/tree/Trailing\_State\_Server\_tests/project\%20code/DAS\%20draken/src}}.
Further more, we proposed a number of experiments to put the system under test, so that when it is implemented it is possible to measure how well the system performs on a number of different characteristics which are important to a distributed system.
